# **Week 1 Summary: Python Basics**

Week 1 introduces Python, setting the foundation for your journey into programming. The week begins with **Day 1**, where you install Python, set up an IDE, and run your first script. This is a crucial step, as it ensures your development environment is ready. You also explore basic programming concepts like printing messages and running Python code interactively.

On **Day 2**, you dive into variables and data types, essential for storing and manipulating data. You learn about integers, floats, strings, and booleans, alongside type conversion and variable naming conventions. These skills form the bedrock of writing meaningful programs.

**Day 3** focuses on strings, a versatile data type for handling text. You explore string methods, concatenation, slicing, and formatting with f-strings. By the end of the lesson, you can manipulate and analyze text efficiently.

The spotlight on **Day 4** shifts to numbers and arithmetic. You work with integers and floats, performing operations like addition, subtraction, and exponentiation. You also discover Python's math module for advanced mathematical functions.

**Day 5** introduces comments and Python's design philosophy, "The Zen of Python." You learn to document your code effectively and embrace simplicity and readability.

Finally, **Days 6 and 7** explore lists, Python's powerful data structure for handling collections. You practice creating, modifying, sorting, and iterating through lists. By the end of Week 1, you’re equipped with essential tools to write and manage Python programs confidently.
