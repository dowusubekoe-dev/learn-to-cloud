## Challenges

### Beginner Level

#### Challenge 1: The Hidden File

Find and read a hidden file in the `ctf_challenges` directory.

- **Skills**: Basic file listing, hidden files concept
- **Hint**: Hidden files in Linux start with a special character

##### Solution

```bash
cd ctf_challenges # change to the ctf_challenges directory
```

```bash
ls -la # list all files in the ctf_challenges directory
```

```bash
cat .hidden_flag # CTF{finding_hidden_treasures}
```

```bash
verify 1 CTF{finding_hidden_treasures} # verify the flag
```

---

#### Challenge 2: The Secret File

Locate a file containing "secret" in its name within /home/ctf_user.

- **Skills**: File searching, directory navigation
- **Hint**: Explore commands that can search through directories

##### Solution

```bash
cd ctf_challenges # change to the ctf_challenges directory. 
```

```bash
find /home/ctf_user -type f -name "*secret*" # find the file containing "secret" in its name. 
# /home/ctf_user/documents/projects/backup/secret_notes.txt  
```

```bash
cat /home/ctf_user/documents/projects/backup/secret_notes.txt # CTF{search_and_discover}
```

```bash
verify 2 CTF{search_and_discover} # verify the flag
```

---

### Intermediate Level

#### Challenge 3: The Largest Log

Identify and read the largest file in /var/log.

- **Skills**: File size analysis, sorting, log navigation
- **Hint**: Look into commands that display file sizes

##### Solution

```bash
ls -lh /var/log # list all files in the /var/log directory and show their sizes
```

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/large_log_file.log | grep -a "CTF" # CTF{size_matters_in_linux}
```

```bash
verify 3 CTF{size_matters_in_linux} # verify the flag
```

---

#### Challenge 4: The User Detective

Find a flag in the .profile of the user with UID 1002.

- **Skills**: User management, system files, permissions
- **Hint**: System files contain user information

##### Solution

```bash
cat /etc/passwd # list all users and their information
```

```bash
grep "1002" /etc/passwd # flag_user:x:1002:1002::/home/flag_user:/bin/sh
```

```bash
sudo grep "CTF{" /home/flag_user/.profile # CTF{user_enumeration_expert}
```

```bash
verify 4 CTF{user_enumeration_expert} # verify the flag
```

#### Challenge 5: The Permissive File

Find a root-owned file with 777 permissions. The flag is the contents of this file.

- **Skills**: Permission understanding, advanced file searching
- **Hint**: Consider both ownership and permission patterns

##### Solution

```bash
sudo su - # switch to the root user
```

```bash
find / -type f -user root -perm 777 -exec cat {} + # find the file with root ownership and 777 permissions

# - `find /`: Start searching from the root directory. You can replace `/` with a specific directory if you want to limit the search.
# -type f: Look for files only.
# -user root: Find files owned by the user root.
# -perm 777: Find files with 777 permissions.
# -exec cat {}: For each file found, execute the cat command to display its contents.
# +: This allows find to pass multiple files to cat at once, which is more efficient.
```

```bash
verify 5 CTF{permission_sleuth} # verify the flag
```

---

### Advanced Level

#### Challenge 6: The Hidden Service

Identify a process on port 8080 and retrieve its flag.

- **Skills**: Process management, networking tools, service inspection
- **Hint**: Network diagnostic tools can reveal running services. Port 8080 is often used for HTTP

##### Solution

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep ':8080'     # list all processes on port 8080. tcp   0   0 0.0.0.0:8080   0.0.0.0:*  LISTEN 
```

```bash
ss -tuln | grep ':8080' # list all processes on port 8080. tcp   LISTEN 0   1    0.0.0.0:8080   0.0.0.0:*
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080 # CTF{network_detective}
```

```bash
verify 6 CTF{network_detective} # verify the flag
```

---
#### Challenge 7: The Encoded Secret

Decode a base64-encoded flag.

- **Skills**: Encoding/decoding, command piping
- **Hint**: Linux provides built-in encoding tools

##### Solution

```bash
cd ctf_challenges # change to the ctf_challenges directory
```

```bash
cat encoded_flag.txt # Display the contents of the encoded_flag.txt file
```

```bash
echo "UTFSR2UyUmxZMjlrYVc1blgyMWhjM1JsY24wSwo=" | base64 --decode # Q1RGe2RlY29kaW5nX21hc3Rlcn0K decode the base64-encoded flag.
```

```bash
echo "Q1RGe2RlY29kaW5nX21hc3Rlcn0K" | base64 --decode # CTF{decoding_master} re-decode the base64-decoded flag.
```

```bash
verify 7 CTF{decoding_master} # verify the flag
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user to enter a Base64-encoded string
read -p "Enter the Base64-encoded string: " encoded_string

# Decode the Base64 string
decoded_string=$(echo "$encoded_string" | base64 --decode)

# Print the decoded string
echo "Decoded string: $decoded_string"

# Decode the Base64 string
decoded_string=$(echo "$decoded_string" | base64 --decode)

# Use grep to find hidden text starting with CTF
echo "$decoded_string"

# Check if hidden text was found and print it
if [ -n "$decoded_string" ]; then
    echo "Found hidden string: $decoded_string"
else
    echo "No hidden text found."
fi
``` 

#### Challenge 8: SSH Key Authentication

Configure SSH key authentication and find a hidden flag.

- **Skills**: SSH configuration, key management, security practices
- **Hint**: Pay attention to file permissions and hidden directories

##### Solution
- From the local machine, generate an SSH key pair.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Save the key in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (default location).

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@target_host # Copy the public key to the target host.(EC2 instance)
```
- If ssh-copy-id is unavailable, manually add the public key to the server:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh user@target_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
- On the target machine, verify the permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- SSH into the Target Machine. Now, attempt to log in using the key:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@target_host
```

```bash
ls -la # Find the hidden files or directories.
```

- Use grep to look for flag-related files:

```bash
grep -r "CTF{" /home/ctf_user/ # CTF{ssh_security_master}
```

```bash
verify 8 CTF{ssh_security_master} # verify the flag
```

## Tips for Success

1. Use `man` pages to understand command options
2. Break down complex problems into smaller steps
3. Understand command combinations using pipes
4. Review basic Linux concepts from Phase 1 Guide
5. Take notes on new commands you discover
